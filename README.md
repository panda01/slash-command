A simple command creator spins up a lone webpage with a textarea where when you type '/addCommand' it will show you a popup to add a command. 
You can enter a name and the actual code
in order to run a command you added simply type / + the name of the command in the textarea i.e.
whatever the last value of your command is will replace the command you typed
